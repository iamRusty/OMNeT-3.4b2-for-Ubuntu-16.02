%description:
Check that rng seeding works properly.
IMPORTANT: FOR (b),(c),... VERSIONS OF THIS TEST, take the (a),
change the runs-to-execute parameter -- result should be the same,
only in different order.

%activity:
for (int i=0; i<ev.numRNGs(); i++)
{
    // note: the intRand() calls cannot be put into the ev<< statement directly, because
    // different compilers evaluate them in different order (see c++-evalorder_1.test)
    unsigned long r1 = rng(i)->intRand();
    unsigned long r2 = rng(i)->intRand();
    ev << "ev.rng-" << i << ": ";
    ev << r2 << "  " << r1 << ", drawn " << rng(i)->numbersDrawn() << "\n";
