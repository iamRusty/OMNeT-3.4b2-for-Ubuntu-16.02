Check that rng seeding works properly.
IMPORTANT: FOR (b),(c),... VERSIONS OF THIS TEST, take the (a),
change the runs-to-execute parameter -- result should be the same,
only in different order.

for (int i=0; i<ev.numRNGs(); i++)

    // different compilers evaluate them in different order (see c++-evalorder_1.test)

    unsigned long r2 = rng(i)->intRand();
