OMNeT++/OMNEST
==============

OMNeT++/OMNEST is a C++-based object-oriented discrete event simulation
framework, primarily targeted at the simulation of communication networks
and other parallel/distributed systems. OMNeT++/OMNEST includes a graphical
network editor, a network topology description language, a simulation class
library, multiple execution environments (both GUI and command line), a
result plotting tool, documentation, many sample simulations and much more.

OMNeT++ is freely available for academic and non-profit purposes; the
commercial version is licensed under the name OMNEST, but otherwise
they are identical.

Please look into the doc/ subdirectory where you'll find README files,
installation instructions, license, the manual in PDF and HTML, tutorials,
etc.

You're invited to visit the OMNeT++ community site at www.omnetpp.org any time!

We hope you'll enjoy working with OMNeT++/OMNEST.
