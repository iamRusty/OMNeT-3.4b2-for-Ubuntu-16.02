	* fix in loadnedfile.cc [reported by Johnny Lai]

2005-08-08  Andras Varga

	* cnednetworkbuilder.cc: assign submodule parameters, gatesizes etc 
	in that submodule's context (use cContextSwitcher); same for network.
	This is mainly needed for ModNameParamResolver to work correctly
	($MODULE_NAME etc for XPath expressions are taken from the module 
	in context).
