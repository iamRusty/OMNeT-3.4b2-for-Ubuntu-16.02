2006-11-17  Andras Varga

	* added MatchExpression class; cPatternMatcher renamed to PatternMatcher

2006-10-21  ------ omnetpp-3.3 released ------

2006-09-13  Andras Varga

	* fix: the simulation can now be in a directory whose path name 
	contains spaces (e.g. "Program Files" or "OMNEST Demo")

	* cInifile::getAsFilenames() enhancement (as part of the above fix):
	if directory name contains spaces, quotes are used to escape it.

	* cinifile.cc/h: added getAsFilename()

2006-06-26  Andras Varga

	* cinifile.cc: clearContents() made public.

2006-03-19  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc: optimized checkTimeLimits() to call gettimeofday() less
	frequently.

2006-02-27  Andras Varga

	* cenvir.cc: implemented getParsimProcId() and getParsimNumPartitions()

2006-02-06  Andras Varga

	* envir.cc: undisposedObject() to print warning if it's called after 
	shutdown (when app==NULL). Source of such call is the destructor of
	the global cDefaultList. Typically only global variables go to 
	that list, and we strongly disapprove global vars.

2006-01-12  ------ omnetpp-3.2p1 released ------

2005-10-19  ------ omnetpp-3.2 released ------

2005-09-22  Andras Varga

	* implemented @@listfile in the preload-ned-files option. 
	See nedc/ChangeLog for more info.

2005-09-12  Andras Varga

        * cenvir.cc, omnetapp.cc/h: default of "perform-gc" option changed to
        false. USER-ALLOCATED OBJECTS ARE NO LONGER DELETED AT NETWORK CLEANUP.

        * new option:
            [General]
            print-undisposed=<bool>, default=true
	Selects whether the list of undisposed user objects is dumped at
	network cleanup (provided perform-gc=false). Ideally, users should
	fix simple module destructors instead of turning this option off.

	* filemgrs.cc/h: added new omnetpp.ini settings to adjust number
	of significant digits recorded into output vector and output scalar
	files:
	    [General]
	    output-scalar-precision=<int>,  default=12
	    output-vector-precision=<int>,  default=12
	The default precision is 12 digits. The following has to be considered
	when changing the default value:

	IEEE-754 doubles are 64-bit numbers. The mantissa is 52 bits, which
	is roughly equivalent to 16 decimal places (52*log(2)/log(10)).
	However, due to rounding errors (see program below), usually only
	12..14 digits are correct, and the rest is pretty much random garbage
	which should be ignored. However, when you convert the decimal
	representation back into an IEEE-754 double (as in Plove and Scalars),
	an additional small error will occurs because 0.1 (0.01, etc) cannot be
	represented precisely in binary. This error of converting to/from
	decimal (text) format is usually smaller than the one that the double
	variable already had before recording it into the file, however if
	it is important you can eliminate it by setting >16 digits precision
	for the file (but again, be aware that the last digits are garbage).

	OMNeT++ internally uses the "%g" format of C's printf(), specifically
	"%.*g". The precision specified in omnetpp.ini simply goes in there.
	The upper limit of precision seems to be 17 digits (setting it higher
	doesn't make any difference in the output).

	To see finite machine precision and rounding errors, try this code:
	    double x = 0.1;
	    while (true)  {
	       printf("%.15g\n", x);
	       x = x + 0.1;
	    }

	The following, more advanced version will also print the error of
	converting back from text to double:
	    double x = 0.1;
	    while (true) {
	        char line[120];
	        sprintf(line, "%.15g \t%.14g \t%.13g \t%.12g", x, x, x, x);
	        double x15, x14, x13, x12;
	        sscanf(line, "%lg%lg%lg%lg", &x15, &x14, &x13, &x12);
	        printf("%s \t| %g  %g  %g  %g\n", line, (x15-x), (x14-x), (x13-x), (x12-x));
	        x = x + 0.1;
	    }

	For the complexity of the issue, see "What Every Computer Scientist
	Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic" by David Goldberg.

2005-08-08  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc: make use of ModNameParamResolver in getXMLDocument().
	This will allow parameters like $MODULE_FULLPATH, $MODULE_INDEX etc
	to be used in XPath expressions (see doc of ModNameParamResolver
	for the full list)

2005-07-24  Andras Varga

	* filemgrs.h/cc: implemented newly added flush() virtual function to
	cFileOutputVectorManager and cFileOutputScalarManager classes

2005-07-07  Andras Varga

	omnetapp.cc: fix: ev.getUniqueNumber() produced garbage if it was
	called from module constructors (its initialization took place too
	late).

2005-05-01  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc: added [General]/perform-gc omnetpp.ini option
	(default=true). If turned off, sim.kernel doesn't do garbage
	collection when deleting the network.

2005-04-05  Andras Varga

	* cinifile.cc: fix: getAsFilenames() crashed if ini file entry is was ""
	[reported by Tom Parker]

	* filemgrs.cc: throw error when output vector file from previous run
	cannot be removed

2005-03-31  ------ omnetpp-3.1 released ------

2005-03-22  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc/h, cenvir.cc: cEnvir::getParameter() return type changed
	from const char * to std::string. This was needed because if the
	parameter value contains the xmldoc() function, getParameter() will
	now modify the file name in it to make it relative to the
	position of the ini file the setting was read from.

	* omnetapp.cc/h: handling of -h option moved into TOmnetApp base class.

2005-03-21  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc: fixed memory leak in shutdown code: RNG objects
	didn't get freed in TOmnetApp destructor. [discovered and patch
	provided by Nigel Sheridan-Smith]

2005-03-18  Andras Varga

	* cinifile.h/cc: implemented getAsFilenames(), getBaseDirectoryFor(),
	getLocation() functions in cInifile: the class now remembers from which
	ini file every entry was read from. Also, class was upgraded to use
	std::vector.

	* the following configuration settings (due to the use of cfg->getAs-
	FileNames() instead of cfg->getAsString()) now became relative to the
	location of the ini file which contains them:
	  [General], load-libs=
	  [Cmdenv], output-file=
	  [Tkenv], bitmap-path=
	  [General], preload-ned-files=
	  [General] or [Run X], output-vector-file=
	  [General] or [Run X], output-scalar-file=
	  [General] or [Run X], snapshot-file=

2005-03-02  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc: fix: RNGs were initialized with run number of the
	previous run

	* omnetapp.h/cc: makeOptionsEffective() merged into readPerRunOptions()

	* omnetapp.cc: fixed ini file imports: included ini file names are now
	understood as relative to the location of the ini file containing the
	"include" directive, rather than to the current working directory.
	E.g. if your omnetpp.ini contains "include ../../settings.ini", then
	settings.ini may now contain "include defaults.ini" (instead of
	"include ../../defaults.ini") to load defaults.ini from the same
	directory.

2005-02-24  Andras Varga

	* cenvir.cc: fix: simple modules etc in dynamically loaded dlls/so's
	([General]/load-libs=, -l command-line option) didn't get registered

2005-02-18  Andras Varga

	* cenvir.cc: ev.printf() fixed: it printed the buffer pointer value
	instead of the string itself. (char buf[20]; strcpy(buf,"hello");
	cout << buf; prints buf's address not "hello"!!!)

	* cenvir.cc: fixed crash caused by writing one char past the
	end of char buffer[1024] in cEnvir::gets().

2005-02-07  Andras Varga

	* cakaroarng.cc: fix: added missing #include

	* cinifile.cc: fix in cInifile::getEntriesWithPrefix(): first check
	for double (overlapping) entries, and make the first one win. This
	fixes wrong priorities of rng mapping entries. [reported by Georg Lutz]

2005-01-10  Andras Varga

	* factored out platform dependencies to include/platdep

2005-01-03  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc: scheduler's startRun() and endRun() methods didn't
	get called

2004-12-29  ------ omnetpp-3.0 released ------

2004-12-16  Andras Varga

	* optimizations

	* removed ev.getDisplayString() and support for display strings in
	omnetpp.ini (section [DisplayStrings])

2004-12-10  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc/.h: implemented getUniqueNumber()

2004-12-08  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc/h, cenvir.cc: added ev.getParameterUseDefault() function.
	New ini file option:
	  <paramname>.use-default = yes
	If set, the given module parameter(s) will use the defaults specified
	in the NED file via the input() operator.

2004-11-29  Andras Varga

  	* on Mac OS/X, implement ftime() with gettimeofday() [patch from
  	Michael Tuexen]

  	* platdep.cc: load-libs= omnetpp.ini option now adds plaform-specific
  	extension (.dll or .so) to library name

2004-11-23  ------ omnetpp-3.0b1 released ------

2004-11-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a9 released ------

2004-10-31  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc: RNG mapping implemented. New ini file entries:
	  [General]
	  <modulepath>.rng-N=M  (where N,M are numeric, M<num-rngs)
	This maps module-local RNG N to physical RNG M. The following
	example maps all "gen" module's default (N=0) RNG to physical RNG 1,
	and all "noisychannel" module's default (N=0) RNG to physical RNG 2.
	  [General]
	  num-rngs=3
	  **.gen[*].rng-0=1
	  **.noisychannel[*].rng-0=2
	This mapping allows variance reduction techniques to be applied to
	OMNeT++ models, without any model change or recompilation.

	* cinifile.cc/h, patmatch.cc/h: added stuff needed for RNG mapping:
	getEntriesWithPrefix(), patternPrefixMatches()

2004-10-28  Andras Varga

	* added cakaroarng.h/cc. Akaroa's RNG has some limitations, see class
	doc for details.

2004-10-27  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.h/cc, cenvir.cc: added numRNGs(), rng(k) functions (see
	include/ChangeLog)

	* omnetapp.cc: new omnetpp.ini entries:
	  [General]
	  num-rngs=n  (default:1)
	  rng-class="classname"  (default:cMersenneTwister)
	classes accepted: "cMersenneTwister", "cLCG32"
	per-run settings:
	  [General] or [Run n]
	  seed-N-mt=seedvalue  (for MT; default: auto seed selection)
	  seed-N-lcg32=seedvalue  (for cLCG32; default: auto seed selection)
	N can be 0..num-rngs; see sim/cmersennetwister.cc and clcg32.cc for
	exact auto-seeding procedure

2004-10-25  Andras Varga

	* updated for fullPath() signature change (see include/ChangeLog)

2004-10-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0a8 released ------

2004-09-24  ------ omnetpp-3.0a7 released ------

2004-07-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a6 released ------

2004-07-06   Andras Varga

	* speedmtr.cc/h: fix: use wall clock time (ftime() call) instead of
	time consumed by the process (clock()) for the ev/sec, simsec/sec
	calculations.

2004-07-05   Andras Varga

	* cenvir.cc,omnetapp.cc/h,filemgrs.cc/h: recordScalar() functions for
	text and cStatistic data removed. (See also include/ChangeLog)

2004-06-22   Andras Varga

	* cenvir.cc, omnetapp.cc/h: added new cEnvir method getXMLDocument().
	* added cxmldoccache.cc/h: contains cXMLDocCache class which reads and
	caches XML config files

2004-06-21   Andras Varga

	* patmatch.cc/h: replaced old transform_pattern() and stringmatch()
	methods with shiny new pattern matching class. cPatternMatcher can do
	case sensitive/insensitive, full string/substring match, and supports
	more pattern features, namely: numeric ranges and distinction between
	"*" and "**". See class documentation for more info

	* inifile.cc/h: cPatternMatcher used as the engine for wildcard
	resolution in ini files. The default mode is "dottedpath on",
	where "*" does NOT match dot ".", so oddities like "foo[*].param"
	matching "foo[1].bar[5].param" will not occur any more. The new
	wildcard "**" will match anything.
	   This change is (of course) NOT backward compatible, so existing
	omnetpp.ini's have to be updated. In practice, every line which begins
	with "*." should be changed to begin with "**." -- that'll do most
	of the time, further tweaking is rarely necessary.
	   In any case: if you still want to run the old omnetpp.ini (e.g. to
	check the new one against it), you can add the line
	         #% old-wildcards
	at the top of (each) old ini file. This will switch back to the old
	behaviour. "#% old-wildcards" is provided to make it easier to migrate
	from OMNeT++ 2.3 to 3.0, and will be removed in some future version.

2004-06-17   Andras Varga

	* cinifile.cc/h: cInifile is now subclassed from cConfiguration
	(see include/ChangeLog). Class interface slightly changed.

	* cenvir.cc: added new ini file option:
	  [General]
	  configuration-class=...
	This makes it possible to use other data source than omnetpp.ini (or
	in general, ini files) for configuration. E.g. it is possible to use
	XML or database input.
	The startup sequence is this (see cEnvir::setup()):
	  1. First, omnetpp.ini (or the ini file(s) specified via the "-f"
	     command-line option) is read.
	  2. Shared libraries in [General]/load-libs are loaded. (Also the
	     ones specified with the "-l" command-line option.)
	  3. [General]/configuration-class is examined, and if it's present,
	     and a configuration object of the given class is instantiated.
	     The configuration object may read further entries from the
	     ini file (e.g. database connect parameters, or XML file name).
	  4. The original omnetpp.ini config object is deleted. No other
	     settings are taken from it.
	  5. [General]/load-libs from the new configuration object is
	     processed.
	  6. Then everything goes on as normal, using the new config object.

2004-05-15  ------ omnetpp-3.0a4 released ------

2004-03-26  Andras Varga

	* filemgrs.h: (patch from Johnny Lai  <johnny.lai@eng.monash.edu.au>):
	made sVectorData protected (it was private)

2004-03-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a3 released ------

2004-03-10  Andras Varga

	* cenvir.cc: updated to reflect changes in cenvir.h (see include/
	ChangeLog)

	* omnetapp.h: puts(const char *) replaced by sputn(const char *, int n)

2004-03-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a2 released ------

2004-02-23  Andras Varga

	* omnetpp.cc/h, cenvir.cc: added moduleReparented() cEnvir method

2004-02-22  Andras Varga

	* added fsutils.cc/h; implemented wildcards in list files

2004-02-10  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc: error messages to display module class name (NED type)
	of current module

2004-02-09  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc/h: preload-ned-files= omnetpp.ini option now supports
	list files (@nedfiles.lst), even recursive ones (list files may refer
	to other list files). Relative or absolute file name paths are also
	allowed in list files; relative paths are relative from the location
	of the list file.

2004-02-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0pre1 released ------

2004-01-09  Andras Varga

	* cenvir.cc, omnetapp.h: added bubble()

2004-01-06  Andras Varga

	* cenvir.cc, omnetapp.h: added isGUI()

2004-01-01  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc/h, cenvir.cc: handle new cEnvir notifications:
	moduleCreated(), moduleDeleted(), connectionCreated(),
	connectionRemoved(), displayStringChanged(cGate*),
	displayStringChanged(cModule*),	displayStringAsParentChanged()

2003-12-11  Andras Varga

	* all files: follow changes in sim/; C-style casts replaced with
	static_cast<>

2003-11-13  Andras Varga

	* Checked in parallel simulation code that was developed March-May 2003,
	during my stay at Monash University. Changes:

	2003-05-12  Andras Varga
	* speedmtr.cc: changed so that if measurement interval (clocks) or
	number of events are small, it refuses to give results (ie. returns
	all zeroes). I had some weird readings other before that...

	2003-04-18  Andras Varga
	* omnetapp.cc: fname-append-host setting now also appends pid (process
	id) to the file names

	2003-03-31  Andras Varga
	* omnetapp.cc/h: parallel simulation ini file options changed.
	New options, with their default values:
          [General]
          scheduler-class="cSequentialScheduler" (only used when par-sim=false)
          parallel-simulation=false
          parsim-communications-class="cFileCommunications"
          parsim-syncronization-class= "cNullMessageProtocol"
	Old, obsoleted options:
	  [General]
	  distributed=...
	  parallel-system=...

	2003-03-23  Andras Varga
	* omnetapp.cc: install scheduler into 'simulation' object on startup --
	see comments in include/ChangeLog about cScheduler

2003-11-09  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc: added support for dynamic loading of NED files.
	The new [General]/preload-ned-files= omnetpp.ini entry may contain
	a list of NED file names, separated by spaces. The NED files will
	be loaded before the user interface is started.

2003-10-02  Andras Varga

	* cenvir.cc, omnetapp.h: added new method cEnvir::moduleMethodCalled(),
	needed for animation of method calls between modules

2003-09-22  Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc, cenvir.cc: messageSent() signature change, see
	include/ChangeLog

2003-06-16  ------ omnetpp-2.3 released ------

2003-03-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b2 released ------

2003-03-15  Andras Varga

	* cinifile.cc/h: bugfix: complained about unterminated last line

2003-03-04  Andras Varga

	* cinifile.cc/h: made it faster to process large ini files (added
	haswildcard field)

2003-02-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b1 released ------

2003-02-14  Andras Varga

	* cinifile.cc: improved handling of lines ~ 1024 chars

2003-01-07  Andras Varga

	* implemented ev.flush()

2002-10-20  Andras Varga

	* misc improvements

2002-10-07  Andras Varga

	* main.cc: added call to ExecuteOnStartup::executeAll().
	See new EXECUTE_ON_STARTUP() macro in include/ChangeLog.

2002-10-04  Andras Varga

	* error handling changed from simulation.ok() to exceptions.

2002-09-21  Andras Varga

	* filemgrs.cc, akoutvectormgr.cc: applied Steffen Sroka's patches
	(thanks Steffen!). AKAROA_CFLAGS added to Makefile.in.

2002-07-08  Andras Varga

	* filemgrs.cc: added fname-append-host=true/false ini file setting.
	When turned on, appends the host name to the names of the output
	files (output vector, output scalar, snapshot files). This is
	useful when the simulation is run on multiple machines concurrently
	(parallel independent runs (Akaroa) or parallel/distributed simulation),
	and all running instances write to the same directory (e.g. shared
	via NFS mount). [Idea from Steffen Sroka's Akaroa extension]

	* added akoutvectormgr.h/cc: integrated Steffen Sroka's Akaroa
	extension that supports multiple independent replicated simulation runs.
	Akaroa can be activated by specifying
	  [General]
	  outputvectormanager-class=cAkOutputVectorManager
	in the ini file. By default, all output vectors are under Akaroa
	control; the <modulename>.<vectorname>.akaroa=false setting can be used
	to make Akaroa ignore specific vectors.
	For more info see the Akaroa home page and the OMNeT++ documentation.

	TBD: Akaroa integration into the makefiles; documentation

2002-06-13  Andras Varga

	* filemgrs.cc: 2 bugfixes: (1) output scalar file did not get opened
	sometimes; (2) output scalar file got removed between runs

2002-05-28  Frank Paehlke  <paehlke@tm.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* filemgrs.cc: Use standard headers and namespaces if
	USE_STD_NAMESPACES is defined

2002-05-16  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* appreg.h (cOmnetAppRegistration): fixed declaration of className()

2002-05-04  ------ omnetpp-2.2 released ------

2002-03-11  Uli Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* filemgrs.cc (initVector): make sure that vp->name is not
	NULL. This would cause a crash on SUN Solaris
	(recordScalar): make sure name is not null

2002-03-03  Andras Varga

	* filemgrs.cc: increased precision of numbers in output vector files
	("%g" fprintf formats changed to "%.9g"). [suggested by George Young]

2002-03-03  Andras Varga

	* Various changes: management of output vectors, output scalars and
	snapshots were moved into to the user interface library. See following
	entries and include/ChangeLog.

	* cenvir.cc: implementation of new cEnvir methods (just forward calls
	to TOmnetApp.)

	* omnetapp.h/cc: new methods; plugin mechanism: cOutputVectorManager,
	cOutputScalarManager, cSnapshotManager. (see new file include/envirext.h)

	* ini file entries no longer supported: [General]/log-parchanges,
	[General]/parchange-file. (Parameter change logging no longer
	supported, see include/ChangeLog).

	* new ini file entries: [General]/outputvectormanager-class,
        outputscalarmanager-class, snapshotmanager-class. They specify the name
        of the output vector manager, etc class to be plugged into Envir.
        The classes must have been registered with Register_Class().
        The default values are cFileOutputVectorManager, cFileOutputScalarManager,
        cFileSnapshotManager.

	* filemgrs.h/cc: new files: implementation if plugin classes:
	cFileOutputVectorManager, cFileOutputScalarManager, cFileSnapshotManager

        * cenvir.cc: bugfix: TOmnetApp::shutdown() was never called from cEnvir.

2002-02-24  Andras Varga

	* exit with status 0 if simulation terminated normally (as determined
        by simulation.normalTermination), otherwise with status 1.

2002-02-14  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* omnetapp.cc (putmsg): Bugfix: if OMNeT++ dies shortly after a
	call to putmsg (e.g. SIGSEGV), the output might not be written
	(especially when redirecting to a file). A call to ::fflush()
	ensures that the stdout buffer is emptied.

2001-10-04 Andras Varga

	* cinifile.h, cinifile.cc: no more upper limit on size of ini file
        (tables are dynamically reallocated if needed)

2001-09-01 Andras Varga

	* CONST_CAST() replaced by const_cast<>()

2001-07-11 Andras Varga

	* omnetapp.cc omnetapp.h: Eric Wu's Tru64/MPI port.
        Added new ini file option: [General]/parallel-system=. Its value
        can be "PVM" or "MPI", defaults to "MPI".

2001-02-27  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.1 released ------

	* Borland C++ support removed: I deleted the project files
	(*.ide). I added equivalent Makefile.bc files (generated from the
	BC IDE), but they are completely unsupported at the moment. If
	there's interest, it's possible that later I'll add makefiles for
	the free command-line bc5.5 compiler.

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0p1 released ------

	* patch to prevent Unix linkers (falsely) report Speedometer as
	missing symbol


2001-02-06  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0 released ------

	* added dllexport to Speedometer

2001-01-16  Andras Varga

	* added Speedometer class

2000-06-19  Andras Varga

	* bugfix: TOmnetApp::getOutVectorConfig() crashed when it was
	called with vecname being NULL (on Solaris; other systems seem to
	tolerate NULL being passed to sprintf() as a "%s" argument)
	[reported by Ulrich Kaage]

2000-05-07  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b5 released ------

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b4 released ------

	* Makefile.vc improvements from Balazs Kelemen

2000-04-10  Andras Varga

	* TRUE/FALSE (defines) replaced by true/false (C++ keywords)

	* in printf() statements, all "%lf","%lg","%le" was replaced by
	"%f","%g","%e"

2000-04-10  Andras Varga (6-10)

	* changes to enable linking a Windows DLL from the library

	* the memoryIsLow() utility function was placed into this library,
	and now it works through a new TOmnetApp::memoryIsLow() function.

	* the "-u <user-interface>" command-line parameter is now
	understood by envir: this can be used to select the user interface
	if both Cmnenv and Tkenv is linked in (or is dynamically loaded).

	The [General]/user-interface= ini file option was also added, with
	the same functionality.

	This allows the user to link the simulation without Cmdenv and
	Tkenv, and load one of them at runtime, with a line like this in
	omnetpp.ini:

		[General]
	         load-libs=../../lib/tkenv.so
	         user-interface=Tkenv
        Or the command-line equivalent:

		mysim  -l ../../lib/tkenv.so  -u Tkenv

	To allow all the above, the setup procedure (cEnvir::setup()) and
	the constructor and the setup() function of TOmnetApp was
	reorganized.

2000-04-04  Andras Varga

	* dynamic registration of user interface (TOmnetApp) classes
	introduced.
	(The formerly used method didn't make it possible to create
	separate DLLs on Windows: envir.dll, tkenv.dll, cmdenv.dll).

	See appreg.h, the Register_OmnetApp macros in cmdenv.cc and
	tkapp.cc, and the chooseBestOmnetApp() function in envir.cc.

2000-03-26  Andras Varga

	* 'char *' pointers made const-correct (lots of 'char *' -->
	'const char *' replacements throughout the code)

2000-01-28  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b3 released ------

	* main stack size increased to 128K (omnetapp.cc)

2000-01-16  Andras Varga

        * improvements in cinifile.cc

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b2 released ------

	* typo fixed in Makefile.in: $(CLFAGS) --> $(CFLAGS)

1999-08-30  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b released ------

        * Fixed a bug in omnetapp.cc which caused bogus reporting in the
	number of random number generators initialized from table and from
	ini file

1999-08-13  Andras Varga

        * cIniFile::readFile()'s include file handling modified. Now the
	included file doesn't need to start with a section header line:
	entries will use the current section header in the including file.
	BUT: section headers in the included file are not propagated back
	to the including file because it could lead to nasty behaviour.

1999-06-21  Andras Varga

        * all sources checked in under CVS

        * makefile.in modified for use with GNU Autoconf; also renamed to
	Makefile.in

1998-07-24  Andras Varga

        * getDisplayString() added to cEnvir and TOmnetApp classes

        * display strings now can be taken from [DisplayStrings] or [Run
	nn] section of the ini file (hardcoded display strings take
	precendence over the ones in the ini file)

        * cIniFile edited -- getRaw() added

1998-07-20  Andras Varga

	Improved cIniFile: wildcards understood in keys; keys may contain
	whitespace Support for output vector configuration from ini file

        * getOutVectorConfig() added to cEnvir and TOmnetApp classes

        * output vector config is taken from [OutVectors] or [Run nn] section.

	  Syntax:
	    module.vectorname.enabled=yes/no
	    module.vectorname.interval=10s..30s
	  Output vectors are enabled by default.

1998-07-15  Andras Varga

        * small fixes

1998-05-20  Andras Varga

        * `ev << ..' conversions for doubles changed

1998-05-12  Andras Varga

        * bugfixes

1998-05-11  Andras Varga

        * multiple -f and -l options: several ini files and libraries can
	be loaded
	(If you want to do several simulation runs with their parameters
	in separate files, multiple -f will be very useful!)

        * ini files can include each other. Syntax:
	    ...
	    include second.ini
	    ...

        * wildcard parameters in ini files. Like:
	    [Parameters]
	    net.station[*].gen_rate=100
	  Wildcard characters are: * ?, and {} for range (using the conventional
	  [] would be very inconvenient because they would interfere with vector
	  indices).

1998-04-27  Andras Varga

        * new ini file option: [General] / total-stack-kb= Holds the total
	stack size (in KB) needed by module coroutines.

        * makefile can now create shared object (libenvir.so)

        * support for dynamic loading of libraries: -l command line
	option.  `foo -l ./token.so' (if `foo' is an OMNeT++ executable)
	will now load the token.so file at startup.

1998-03-26  Andras Varga

        * use of gets() eliminated

1998-02-15  Andras Varga

        * makefile made compatible with configure script;

        * new ini file entry: [General]/netif-check-freq=  (default:1)

        * compatibility: sim146a

1997-08-08  Andras Varga

        * other [Slaves] options added that control whether different kinds of

	  textual messages should be routed to the console:
	     errmsgs-to-console=
	     infomsgs-to-console=
	     modmsgs-to-console=

        * updated for sim144c

1997-08-07  Andras Varga

        * omnetapp.cc: cNetSimpleMod corrected to cNetMod

        * compatibility: sim144a or later

1997-08-04  Andras Varga

        * fixed a bug with reporting how many rnd gens were initialized from table

        * [Slaves]/module-messages= flag added; works similarly to
	Cmdenv's.  Default value is NO: module messages from slaves do not
	appear on console.

1997-07-31  Andras Varga

        * a bug introduced in #96 fixed

        * [General]/number-of-runs= ini file setting was removed; its
	place is taken by [Cmdenv]/runs-to-execute=

        * added: cInifileSectionIterator

        * compatible with: cmdenv87 and up

1997-07-20  Andras Varga

	Ini file reader improved; '#' as well as ';' can be used for
	comments Improvements on distributed execution:

        * ini file options added to enable logging of messages produced by
	slaves:

	     [Slaves]
	     write-slavelog = true/false
	     slavelog-file = slave.log
	  Output between TSlaveApp creation and ini file processing is written in
	  the file "slave.log".

        * changed TOmnetApp::foreignputs()

1997-07-10  Andras Varga

        * makefile hacked upon to make it edible for Cygnus gcc

        * main stack enlarged from 16K to 32K (cenvir.cc)

1997-06-26  Andras Varga

        * enable_modmsgs flag added. If set to FALSE, makes ev.printf()
	and ev.puts() return immediately without doing anything.
	Motivation was to decrease overhead when running the simulation at
	full speed and module messages are not needed.
