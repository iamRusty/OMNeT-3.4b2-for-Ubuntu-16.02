2005-03-31  ------ omnetpp-3.1 released ------

2005-03-22  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc/h: handling of -h option moved into TOmnetApp base class.

2005-03-02  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.h/cc: makeOptionsEffective() merged into readPerRunOptions()

2005-01-10  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: factored out platform dependencies to include/platdep

2004-12-29  ------ omnetpp-3.0 released ------

004-12-15  Andras Varga

        * extra-stack= option replaced with extra-stack-kb. (Default is 8K) 

22004-11-23  ------ omnetpp-3.0b1 released ------

2004-11-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a9 released ------

2004-10-27  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: minor ajustment: makeOptionsEffective() should be called 
	right after readPerRunOptions()

2004-10-25  Andras Varga
	
	* cmdenv.cc: updated for info() and fullPath() signature changes 
	(see include/ChangeLog)

2004-10-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0a8 released ------

2004-09-24  ------ omnetpp-3.0a7 released ------

2004-07-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a6 released ------

2004-07-10  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc/h: now it's possible to control which modules' ev<< output
	Cmdenv prints when run with express-mode=false and module-messages=
	true. The configuration is: [Cmdenv]/<modulepath>.ev-output=true/false.
	An example which enables only output from modules named "tcpdump":
	  [Cmdenv]
	  module-messages=true
	  **.tcpdump.ev-output=true
	  **.ev-output=false
	ev<< in finish() is always fully printed.

2004-07-06  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: fixed Speedometer usage; added milliseconds to elapsed
	time. FIXME calculated + speedometer values don't correspond because
	the two call ftime() independently

2004-06-07  ------ omnetpp-3.0a5 released ------

2004-05-15  ------ omnetpp-3.0a4 released ------

2004-03-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a3 released ------

2004-03-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a2 released ------

2004-02-23  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: new omnetpp.ini option:
	    event-banner-details= true/false (default: false).
	It is in effect with normal mode (express-mode=false), and causes
        elapsed time and number of messages (created,present, in FES) to be
        printed in a second line below the event banner. Format:
           Elapsed: 131s (2m 11s)  Messages: created: 45 present: 45 in FES: 18
        Also changed the format of elapsed time display in express mode:
        prints it in seconds as well.

2004-02-11  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: propagated semantic change in getNextEvent()'s and
	selectNextModule()'s return value (see include/ChangeLog)

2004-02-05  Andras Varga

	* heap.cc made disabled by default (and has to be explicitly enabled
	by defining USE_CMDENV_HEAPDEBUG), and changed to throw std::alloc
	on out-of-memory condition.

2004-02-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0pre1 released ------

2004-01-06  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.h: added isGUI()

2003-12-11  Andras Varga

	* all files: follow changes in sim/; C-style casts replaced with
	static_cast<>

2003-11-13  Andras Varga

	* Checked in parallel simulation code that was developed March-May 2003,
	during my stay at Monash University. Changes:

	2003-04-18  Andras Varga
	* new ini file option:
	  output-file=<filename>
	If present, output will be redirected to the given file. If the
	[General]/fname-append-host setting is turned on, the the host
	name and pid (process id) will be appended to the file name.
	Particularly useful when a parallel simulation is run from a shared
	directory.

2003-10-02  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc/h: added new method cEnvir::moduleMethodCalled()

2003-09-22  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc/h: messageSent() signature change, see include/ChangeLog

2003-06-16  ------ omnetpp-2.3 released ------

2003-03-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b2 released ------

2003-02-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b1 released ------

2003-01-07  Andras Varga

	* new ini file options:
	  autoflush=yes/no (default: no)
	    call fflush(stdout) after each event banner or status update;
	    affects both express and normal mode.
	  message-trace=yes/no (default: no)
	    log message sending (by send(),scheduleAt(), etc) and delivery
	    on standard output; effective only in normal mode

	* format of event banner slightly changed

2002-11-03  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: improved status display

2002-10-20  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: revised omnetpp.ini entries understood by Cmdenv.
	A new entry was introduced to make it easier to switch between
	typical uses of Cmdenv.
	  express-mode=yes/no (default: no)
	Normal (non-express) mode is for debugging: detailed information
	will be written	to the standard output (event banners, module output,
	etc). Express mode can be used for long simulation runs: only
	periodical status update is displayed about the progress of the
	simulation.
	When in normal (non-express) mode, the following ini file entries
	are taken into account:
	  module-messages=yes/no (default: yes)
	     - printing module ev<< output on/off (as before)
	  event-banners=yes/no (default: yes)
	     - printing event banners on/off; replaces verbose-simulation=
	When in express mode, these entries are used:
	  status-frequency=<integer> (default: 50000)
	     - print status update every n events (on today's computers, and
	     for a typical model, this will produce an update every few seconds,
	     perhaps a few times per second)
	  performance-display=yes/no (default: yes)
	     - print detailed performance status
	Obsoleted entries: display-update=, verbose-simulation=.

2002-10-08  Andras Varga

	* cmdenv.cc: -h command-line option now lists linked-in modules too

2002-10-04  Andras Varga

	* error handling changed from simulation.ok() to exceptions.

2002-05-04  ------ omnetpp-2.2 released ------

2002-01-13  Andras Varga

	* Graceful handling of SIGTERM and SIGINT signals: calls finish()
        for current simulation and exits. Works on Unix only (Win32 doesn't
        support SIGTERM and SIGINT, among others). Based on suggestion and
        patch from Michele Baresi.

2000-06-06  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.1 released ------

	* Borland C++ support removed: I deleted the project files
	(*.ide). I added equivalent Makefile.bc files (generated from the
	BC IDE), but they are completely unsupported at the moment. If
	there's interest, it's possible that later I'll add makefiles for
	the free command-line bc5.5 compiler.


	* ------ omnetpp-2.0p1 released ------

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0 released ------

	* heap.cc, operator new fixed: when out of memory, it doesn't
	return NULL but calls exit(1). (According to the ISO standard, op
	new should throw an exception when out of memory. Unfortunately,
	exceptions are incompatible with the coroutine library's
	setjmp/longjmp magic, so OMNeT++ doesn't use exceptions at all.)

	HEAP.CC TO BE TESTED!!!

2000-05-10  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b5 released ------

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b4 released ------

	* [Cmdenv]/extra-stack= option added, it specifies (in bytes) how
	much extra stack each activity() module needs when executing under
	Cmdenv.  This used to be hardcoded (8192), now users can fine-tune
	it.

2000-05-07  Andras Varga

       * Makefile.vc improvements from Balazs Kelemen

2000-04-10  Andrea Varga

	* changes to enable linking a Windows DLL from the library

	* memoryIsLow() reorganized; cosmetic changes on heap.cc

	* adjustments because of TOmnetApp constructor changes

	* added cmdenvDummy()/envirDummy(): functions which can/should be
	called from Envir in order to force the linker to include the
	Cmdenv library into the executable. (These functions do absolutely
	nothing.)

	* TRUE/FALSE (defines) replaced by true/false (C++ keywords)

	* in printf() statements, all "%lf","%lg","%le" was replaced by
	"%f","%g","%e"

2000-04-04  Andras Varga

	* dynamic registration of user interface (TOmnetApp) classes
	introduced: Register_OmnetApp() macro added to cmdenv.cc

2000-03-26  Andras Varga

	* 'char *' pointers made const-correct (lots of 'char *' -->
	'const char *' replacements throughout the code)

1999-12-05  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b3 released ------

        * Makefile.vc added

1999-12-04  Andras Varga

	all .cc files to .cpp for compiling (ren *.cc *.cpp)!

        * To Do: check heap.cc

1999-09-20  Andras Varga

        * compatibility: sim144a or up

1997-07-31  Andras Varga

        * [General]/number-of-runs= ini file option was replaced by

	  [Cmdenv]/runs-to-execute=.
	  Now it's possible to say things like:
	     [Cmdenv]
	     runs-to-execute = 1,2, 5-8
	  There is a command-line equivalent: -r1,2,5-8
	  If the list of runs is not given explicitly, executes all runs
	  that have an ini file section; if no runs are given in the ini file,
	  does one run.

        * compatibility: envir97 or newer
