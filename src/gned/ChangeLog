2005-09-22  Andras Varga

	* fixed bogus handling of empty comments: stray "//"'s appeared in
	the source after using the Properties dialogs.

	* allow "++" to be used on parent module gates (this got enabled 
	in nedtool and netbuilder as well)

2005-09-16  Andras Varga

	* connprops.tcl, data.tcl: some further fixes on gate selection in
	the connprops dialog

2005-09-15  Andras Varga

	* checked in another bunch of patches from Michael Franzen:

	- dragdrop.tcl: modified "dragAndDropFinish" to take canvas scroll 
	  position into account
 
	- plotedit.tcl: modified "drawEnd" to set srcgate to "in" and 
	  destgate to "out" in case of connections to a parent-module
 
	- connprops.tcl: changed "editConnectionProps" to replace gate indices 
	  "..." by a reasonable number to avoid error in "fill gate size" and 
	  to make usage of the dialog somewhat more comfortable

	- connprops.tcl: changed "refreshGateCombo": "++" is no longer added 
	  to parent module connections (since this is not valid there)

2005-08-09  Andras Varga

	* reorganized and improved connection properties dialog

2005-07-27  Andras Varga

	* implemented import paths: searching imported files in import 
	directories, import path edit dialog, etc.

2005-07-26  Andras Varga

	* integrated several patches from Michael Franzen:

	- "Open imported files automatically": tries to open all the files 
	that are imported by an opened NED file. (It takes care that every NED 
	file is opened only once.)

	- "Auto-calculate gate size": When switched on, this option generates 
	"gatesize" entries for every port of a module that is endpoint for 
	indexed connections. The code searches for the maximum index of all 
	connections ending at that port and generates the "gatesize" entry 
	from that. If no indexed connection to the port is found, the 
	"gatesize" entry is removed again.

	- "Set 'nocheck' for new modules": generates "connections nocheck" for
	all newly generated modules. This feature has a counterpart in the 
	property page of modules: I added a checkbox "Do not check connections 
	(nocheck)" to enable/disable this feature for each module individually.

	This latter option and the "gatesize" option got a warning-dialog that 
	pops up when they are used for the first time (using your 
	hints-mechanism)  to make the user aware of the consequences that usage 
	of the respective feature may have.

	- to add default icon from right comment of dragged modules, if right 
	comment starts with "deficon: ..." (this a *temporary* solution for
	specifying a default icon)

	- dragging a module on the canvas: deselect all items before selecting
	the newly dropped one


2005-07-24  Andras Varga

	* checked in patches from Michael Franzen: 

	- new option "Autoextend gates using gate++ notation". When this option
	is enabled (Options Menu), GNED does not generate "gatesizes" sections,
	and automatically uses the extension operator "++" on all ports that 
	are connected. However, you always can use indices in the property page
	of modules to override automatic port extension.

        - "Snap to Grid" did not work when dragging a new module on the canvas
        
        - deleting multiple selected objects often resulted in an error message.

2005-04-04  Andras Varga

	* fix: gned didn't understand module parameters of type xml, introduced
	in 3.0.

2005-03-31  ------ omnetpp-3.1 released ------

2005-03-30  Andras Varga

	* plotedit.tcl: update canvas scrollregion after move/create
	operations

	* plotedit.tcl, datadict.tcl: changes module type of freshly created
	submodule from Module to Unknown. When user double-clicks on an Unknown
	submodule, tell him/her to fill in the submodule type.

2005-01-17  Andras Varga

	* combobox.tcl updated to version 2.3 which also works on Mac OS/X 
	[suggested by Michael Tuexen]

2004-12-29  ------ omnetpp-3.0 released ------

2004-12-14  Andras Varga

	* auto-adjust parent module size when submodules are drawn/moved

2004-12-10  Andras Varga

	* default background color changed from #c0c0c0 to #d0d0d0 

	* fixes: strip end-line spaces in generated NED file; extra newline
	was generated after imports

2004-11-29  Andras Varga

	* ebnf.y: malloc.h changed to stdlib.h. Change needed for Mac OS/X 
	[patch from Michael Tuexen]

        * widgets.tcl: updated Tcl/Tk version check

2004-08-16  Andras Varga

        * dispstr.tcl: fix: generate only either "i=" or "b=" tag in display
        strings (TBD gned doesn't support using "i=" and "b=" together)

2004-07-27  Andras Varga

        * ebnf.lex: fixed "`yytext_ptr' undeclared" error with some flex 
        versions

2004-03-23  Andras Varga
        
        * menuproc.tcl: bugfix: in the treeview, right click + Save always
        saved the file of the currently open canvas, not the right-clicked one.
        [reported by V.T.Nguyen]

2004-03-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a3 released ------

2004-03-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a2 released ------

2004-02-22  Andras Varga

        * ebnf.lex,ebnf.y,makened.tcl,datadict.tcl: support for new "gate++"
        NED construct (temporary, until gned gets ported to nedxml)

2004-02-11  Andras Varga

        a paremeter reference, e.g. "o=$color"

        * implemented File|Export EPS... function

        * widgets.tcl: added BLT support

        * gned.cc, tklib.cc, tkcmd.cc reorganized

2003-11-24  Andras Varga

        * added Back and Forward toolbar icons; added "New component" toolbar
        icon; improved icon selection dialog; etc.

2003-10-24  Andras Varga

        * usability improvements (tooltips wording change, some icons 
        redesigned, opens Properties dialog when creating new simple module, 
        import, network, etc.)

2003-09-08  Andras Varga

        * bugfix: textedits were not saved until you switched back to graphics
        mode

2003-09-04  Andras Varga

        * implemented "Consult module declaration" button

2003-09-02  Andras Varga

        * canvas.tcl, main.tcl: GUI layout rearranged a bit for usability 
        reasons

        * plotedit.tcl: cursor changes over canvas items

2003-09-01  Andras Varga

        * canvas.tcl, widgets.tcl: turned on Undo/Redo feature in editor
        also added to Edit menu and toolbar. Requires fairly recent Tcl/Tk.

2003-08-12  Andras Varga

        * combobox.tcl: on FocusOut event, it always restored the old content
        of the entry, so it wasn't possible to type something that was not
        in the list

2003-08-12  Andras Varga
        
        * enhancement: in Submodule and Network Properties dialogs, choose 
        module list from combobox.
        
        * enhancement: in Connection Properties dialogs, module and gate 
        can be selected from combo, and channel also. Input is also fully 
        validated. 

2003-08-11  Andras Varga

        * bugfix: using the Module/Submodule/Connection/Network/Channel/... 
        Properties dialogs didn't make the NED file "dirty" (=with unsaved
        changes) and didn't update the canvas (changing the name in the 
        dialog didn't reflect on the canvas)

        * enhancement: input in Properties dialogs are now (mostly) validated

        * "Machines" pages removed from Module/Submodule dialogs (was obsolete).

2003-08-04  Andras Varga

        * bugfix: if a simple module was typed in the NED text, it was lost 
        when switching back to graphics

        * bugfix: when a loop connection was deleted in graphics mode, 
        empty for loop was left behind which is syntactically invalid in NED

        * bugfix: disallow reserved words as name for submodules, modules, etc.
        TBD not checked for parameter names yet

2003-08-01  Andras Varga

        * random submodule placement (used when display string doesn't contain
        coordinates) changed to work identically to Tkenv: x is random and
        y keeps growing

2003-07-28  Andras Varga

        * canvas.tcl, gned.tcl: implemented "export postscript and exit" mode;
        also exports images.xml that contains info for creating clickable image
        maps

2003-06-16  ------ omnetpp-2.3 released ------

2003-03-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b2 released ------

2003-03-15  Andras Varga

        * fixed bug: gates added via the Properties dialog were generated
        with wrong NED syntax

2003-02-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b1 released ------

2003-02-14  Andras Varga

        * no limit on ned file line length

2003-01-30  Andras Varga

        * changed connection drawing: now default mode is "auto", then if user
        insists on exact placement by dragging the arrow, it changes to 
        "manual" mode. 
        
        * fixed bug that it always created display strings for connections
        [hint from Steffen Sroka].

        * double click on a submodule which is a simple module now opens 
        module properties dialog

        * increased default size of enclosing module rectangle

2003-01-19  Andras Varga

        * Cygwin fixes; put checkTckTkVersion and setupTkOptions (was generic_-
        bindings) into widgets.tcl

2003-01-12  Andras Varga

        * tree view improved

2003-01-11  Andras Varga

        * main.tcl: appearance of menus on Unix made more contemporary 
        (via option add's)

2003-01-04  Andras Varga

        * props.tcl: Module/Submodule/etc Properties dialogs now validate 
        values entered in the Parameters, Gates, Machines etc. tables, 
        so that invalid values no longer cause errors. (new proc validate-
        AttrValue)

2002-12-03  Andras Varga

        * plotedit.tcl: bugfix: it was not possible to draw exactly horizontal 
        or vertical connection arrows

        * drawopts.tcl: bugfix: Tcl error when icon in loaded NED file was not 
        found

2002-11-28  Andras Varga

        * drawopts.tcl: icon selection dialog improved

2002-11-12 Andras Varga

        * ported to Tk8.4 (several 'char *' to 'const char *' changes)

2002-11-04  Andras Varga

        * ebnf.y: synchronized with nedc

2002-05-04  ------ omnetpp-2.2 released ------

2002-04-06  Andras Varga

        * main.tcl: Fix for Cygwin: checkVersion complained about tk_patchLevel
        '8.0.4'. (In earlier versions, tk_patchLevel had the format '8.0p4').

        * *.tcl: puts "dbg: ..." statements replaced by a debug procedure, with
        debugging currently turned off.

2002-02-29  Andras Varga

        * findrepl.tcl: implemented backwards search/replace

2002-02-24  Andras Varga

        * gned.cc: bugfix: gned.exe with WinMain() didn't accept command-line
        file arguments that contained backslashes

2001-10-06  Andras Varga

        * findrepl.tcl: regexp replace improved (\1,\2 in replace string now work
        as expected)

2001-09-01 Andras Varga

        * CONST_CAST() replaced by const_cast<>()

2001-07-23  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * parsened.cc (error): use macro CONST_CAST (defined at top of
        file) to avoid compilation errors with gcc-2.95.3
        * ebnf.y (addGate): CONST_CAST again

2001-07-11  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * Makefile.vc (ebnf.tab.cc) (lex.yy.cc): use "copy" and "del" instead of "mv"

        *  (Repository):
        removed files: ebnf.tab.c lex.yy.c
        new files: ebnf.tab.cc lex.yy.cc

        * Makefile.in
        targets renamed:
                ebnf.tab.c  ->  ebnf.tab.cc
                lex.yy.c    ->  lex.yy.cc
        (ebnf.tab.cc): mv ebnf.tab.c to ebnf.tab.cc
        (lex.yy.cc): mv lex.yy.c to lex.yy.cc
        (lex.yy.o): renamed lex.yy.c to lex.yy.cc
        (ebnf.tab.o): renamed ebnf.tab.c to ebnf.tab.cc


        * Makefile.vc
        targets renamed:
                ebnf.tab.c  ->  ebnf.tab.cc
                lex.yy.c    ->  lex.yy.cc
        (ebnf.tab.cc): mv ebnf.tab.c to ebnf.tab.cc
        (lex.yy.cc): mv lex.yy.c to lex.yy.cc
        (lex.yy.obj): renamed lex.yy.c to lex.yy.cc
        (ebnf.tab.obj): renamed ebnf.tab.c to ebnf.tab.cc

        * Makefile.bc
        (ebnf.tab.obj): renamed ebnf.tab.c to ebnf.tab.cc
        (lex.yy.obj): renamed lex.yy.c to lex.yy.cc

2001-07-11 Andras Varga

        * ebnf.y: Eric Wu's Tru64/MPI port. Tru64 needs extra #includes.

2001-05-18  Andras Varga

        * ------ omnetpp-2.1 released ------

        * Windows: added rc file with icon

2001-05-02  Andras Varga

        * fixed Help|README when using compiled-in Tcl code

2001-04-20  Andras Varga

        * bugfix in new WinMain() startup code

2001-04-16  Andras Varga

        * GNED can now be compiled as GUI application (not console app) on
        Windows, setting USE_WINMAIN=yes in configuser.vc.  NOTE: main()
        and WinMain() use completely different startup sequences.  The
        reason: main()'s startup code with WinMain would result in an
        "unknown channel stdout" error in the Tcl code (and it's not so
        easy to create a dummy channel named stdout), while WinMain()'s
        startup sequence with main() would result in a working command
        prompt in the console window (!!!).  Pretty weird.

        * added gned.ico

2001-03-27  Andras Varga

        * Makefile.vc change: replaced $(GNED_EMBED_SUFFIX) with
        $(GNED_EMBED_TCL).

2001-03-10  Andras Varga

        * Borland C++ support removed: I deleted the project files
        (*.ide). I added equivalent Makefile.bc files (generated from the
        BC IDE), but they are completely unsupported at the moment. If
        there's interest, it's possible that later I'll add makefiles for
        the free command-line bc5.5 compiler.

2001-02-13  Andras Varga

        * ------ omnetpp-2.0p1 released ------

        * ------ omnetpp-2.0 released ------

        * fixed bug which caused the "Drawing options" dialog to go behind
        the main app window after closing the color selection dialog

        * fixed handling of comments in all "Properties" dialogs (messed
        up newlines)

2001-02-06  Andras Varga

        * make clean didn't delete tclcode.cc

2001-01-21  Andras Varga

        * fixed bug with Ctrl-N (Find next) binding

2001-01-16  Andras Varga

        * fix: added Tcl_FindExecutable(argv[0]) to Tcl initialization
        code (needed by Cygwin 1.1)

2001-01-02  Andras Varga

        * cosmetic changes in plotedit.tcl

2000-12-22  Andras Varga

        * implemented scrolling for the tabs strip (the one with the names
        of the open canvases) if there're too many tabs on it

2000-12-18  Andras Varga

        * implemented Channel Properties dialog

        * old display string classes (disp.cc) removed

        * small bugfix on comment handling in Properties dialogs (no
        longer adds extra blank lines)

2000-12-17  Andras Varga

        * improvement: switching from text mode to graphics made faster:
        now GNED won't parse the ned source if it hasn't been edited

        * improvement: GNED will refuse to exit or close a NED file if
        there are text mode canvases with edits. You'll have to switch
        those canvases to graphics to get the NED source backparsed.

        * Connection Properties dialog implemented. (Cannot handle 'for'
        loops yet.)

2000-11-20  Andras Varga

        * improvement: File|Close and File|Exit made more graceful -- the
        "Not saved, save?" dialog now has a Cancel button

        * improvement: implemented File|Save all

        * bugfix: new submodules, modules, channels etc. now always get
        unique names

2000-11-19  Andras Varga

        * bugfix: removed bogus asserts around parsened.cc#70 and #140
        which caused the program to abort when NED code contained two
        submodules with the same name when switching from text to
        graphics.

2000-11-19  Andras Varga

        * display string handling rewritten. Now GNED won't delete from
        the display strings the tags it doesn't understand. New file:
        dispstr.tcl.

        * XML support (experimental): GNED can now export and import XML
        files.
        (File|Import XML...,Export XML... menu items) New files in GNED:
        genxml.tcl, parsexml.tcl.

        * IMPORTANT! XML SUPPORT REQUIRES THE TclXML PACKAGE, at least
        version 1.2.
        (The contents of TclXML-1.2.tgz should be extracted under the
        tcl/lib/ dir.)  BUG in the TclXML-1.2 parser: it silently discards
        attributes which contain '&' or '<' characters!!!!

2000-09-30  Andras Varga

        * improvement just for Cygwin: lexer now explicitly ignores '\r'
        (=CR) chars

2000-08-29  Andras Varga

        * command-line arg handling improved

2000-08-27  Andras Varga

        * drag&drop creation of submodules now creates unique names
        (changed addItem, renameItem procs)

        * deleteItem proc improved

        * renaming improved; "rename..." added to canvas popup menu

2000-08-26  Andras Varga

        * added .gnedrc

        * find/replace operation improved

        * implemented "find next"

        * find/replace dialog contents is now preserved

        * open/save dialogs now remember the directory

2000-08-07  Andras Varga

        * makefile changes for RPM support

2000-07-26  Andras Varga

        * minor fixes on Edit|Find

2000-07-17  Andras Varga

        * accepts NED files on the command line

2000-05-19  Andras Varga

        * ------ omnetpp-2.0b5 released ------

        * ------ omnetpp-2.0b4 released ------

        * fixed <Ctrl-H> in text editor

2000-05-07  Andras Varga

        * Makefile.vc improvements from Balazs Kelemen

2000-04-13  Andras Varga

        * ebnf.y: changed operator precedence to bind ||,&& thighter than
        ?: [suggested by Niko]

2000-04-10  Andras Varga

        * in the C++ sources, TRUE/FALSE (defines) replaced by true/false
        (C++ keywords)

        * in printf() statements, all "%lf","%lg","%le" was replaced by
        "%f","%g","%e"

2000-03-27  Andras Varga

        * bugfix: conditional (?:) operator caused parse error [reported
        by Niko]

1999-12-19  Andras Varga

        * ------ omnetpp-2.0b3 released ------

        * wsize proc added to widgets.tcl

        * font changes

1999-12-06  Andras Varga

        * adapted to Tcl8.2: font size changed.

        * improved dialog box positioning

        * added label-entry-chooser to widgets.tcl

1999-12-05  Andras Varga

        * Makefile.vc added

1999-12-05  Andras Varga

        * compiled with MSVC. enbf.h added. Removed changing slashes to
        backslashes in OMNETPP_GNED_DIR and ..BITMAP_PATH on Win32 because
        Tcl/Tk accepts both.

        * added generated files enbf.tab.c and lex.yy.c to CVS to make it
        possible to build GNED where flex/bison is not available

1999-12-02  Andras Varga

        * implemented Imports, Channel, Network Properties dialogs

        * adjusted tree-view context menus

1999-11-30  Andras Varga
