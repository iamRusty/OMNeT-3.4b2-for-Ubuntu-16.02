 * is a common facade for the Cmdenv and Tkenv user interfaces (and any
 * other future user interface).
 *
 * cEnvir has only one instance, the ev global variable.
 *
 * cEnvir member functions can be rougly divided into two groups:
 *  - I/O for module activities; actual implementation is different for each
 *    user interface (e.g. stdin/stdout for Cmdenv, windowing in Tkenv)
 *  - functions for exchanging information between the simulation and the
 *    environment.
 *
 * The implementation of cEnvir is <b>not</b> part of the simulation kernel,
 * it is in a separate library (the Envir library; see src/envir). This means that
 * customizers are free to replace the environment of the simulation as
 * they like, by simply linking the executable with a different library.
 *
 * The default (Envir library) implementation of cEnvir delegates its task to an
 * internal "simulation application" object. Cmdenv and Tkenv inherit from the
 * default simulation application class.
 *
 * The default (src/envir) implementation of cEnvir can be customized
 * by subclassing the classes declared in the envirext.h header (e.g.
 * cConfiguration, cRNG, cOutputVectorManager, cOutputScalarManager),
 * and selecting the new classes from <tt>omnetpp.ini</tt>.
